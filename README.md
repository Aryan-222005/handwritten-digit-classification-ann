# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Classification using ANN

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based project that classifies handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset.

This project demonstrates a **complete Deep Learning pipeline** including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and error analysis.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Classifies handwritten digits using ANN
- End-to-end ML pipeline implementation
- Model evaluation using classification metrics
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Error analysis on misclassified images
- Accuracy and loss visualization

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is **MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)**.

- Total samples: 70,000
- Image size: 28 × 28 (grayscale)
- Classes: 10 (digits 0–9)

## 🧠 Deep Learning Pipeline

This project follows a complete workflow:

1. Data Loading
2. Data Preprocessing (Normalization, Flattening, Encoding)
3. Model Building (ANN)
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Visualization
7. Error Analysis

---

## 🤖 Model Used

**Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

Architecture:

- Input Layer: 784 neurons (flattened image)
- Hidden Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation
- Output Layer: 10 neurons with Softmax

---

## 📊 Results

- Accuracy: ~98%
- Stable training with minimal overfitting

---

## ❌ Error Analysis

- Misclassification occurs between visually similar digits:
  - 3 ↔ 5  
  - 4 ↔ 9  
  - 8 ↔ 3 / 9  

- Reasons:
  - Similar shapes
  - Handwriting variations
  - Loss of spatial information due to flattening

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- ANN does not capture spatial relationships in images  
- Performance saturates around ~98%  
- Struggles with complex patterns  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Use CNN for better performance  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Add Dropout for regularization  
- Deploy using FastAPI / Streamlit  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### 🧠 Key Learnings
ANN performs well for simple image classification (~98%)
However, it fails to capture spatial relationships
CNN is better suited for image-based tasks
